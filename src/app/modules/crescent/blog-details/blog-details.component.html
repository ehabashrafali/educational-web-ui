         How to Influence Our Children

      <p>🎉 Starting the new year with a significant blog, continuing the discussion about making the right choice in selecting a teacher (educator). Today, I'll talk about the second part related to influencing children's lives, sharing childhood memories.</p>
      <p><span class="font-semibold">1. The First Situation:</span> Every morning since I became aware of the world, my father tries to wake me up at dawn. As a stubborn child, I could have resisted, but my father is determined that I get up, not just for a day or two but as a consistent habit.</p>
      <p><span class="font-semibold">2. The Second Situation:</span> In the summer of 2006, arriving in Alexandria, exhausted, everyone in the family went to sleep except my father. He took me to explore the mosque in the area first and then buy some food.</p>
      <p><span class="font-semibold">3. The Third Situation:</span> Walking after Fajr prayer one winter night, worried about cheating in exams, my father replied, "Say, 'Is it equal - those who know and those who do not know?'"</p>
      <p><span class="font-semibold">4. The Fourth Situation:</span> While working the night shift, my father, despite having a break for Fajr prayer, ensured I woke up for Fajr, even calling during his break if I was away.</p>
      <p><span class="font-semibold">5. The Fifth Situation:</span> Traveling abroad for the first time without my father, he adjusted to the time difference, calling me for Fajr.</p>
      <p><span class="font-semibold">6. The Sixth Situation:</span> After completing Umrah, tired, with only an hour left for Fajr, we chose to wait in the mosque to not miss praying in the Haram Mosque during our short stay.</p>
      <p>These memories are deeply engraved in my mind, illustrating the educational experiences that have influenced me. My father instilled in me the habit of Fajr prayer in the mosque, and though he may not have directly spoken about prayer's significance, his actions spoke louder.</p>
      <p>✨ Many parents ask me to talk to their children about prayer, yet they may not realize that the primary responsibility lies with them. Our children mirror our values, and what truly impacts them is what we instill in them while they are young.</p>
      <p>🎗️ I know some parents may say they try with their children, but it doesn't always work. The question is, how long will we keep trying? I choose to write this post at Fajr time, and my father just checked to ensure I'm awake. From his perspective, you keep trying until you meet your Creator, and the outcome is not in your hands; God will ask about your efforts, not the result.</p>
      <p>I've chosen Fajr prayer as an example because it's one of the most challenging habits for parents to instill, but it only requires a parent with a strong commitment to education. More importantly, be a role model for your children in prayer.</p>

         Why Do We Learn Tajweed?

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Linguistic and Technical Meaning</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
         <li><strong>Linguistically:</strong> Tajweed means enhancement and perfection.</li>
         <li><strong>Technically:</strong> It is the science that outlines the rules and principles to be followed when reciting the Noble Qur’an, exactly as it was transmitted from the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. It involves giving each letter its due—regarding articulation, characteristics, and movements—without exaggeration or artificiality.</li>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Why Learn Tajweed?</h2>
      <p class="mb-2">The main objective of learning Tajweed is to safeguard the tongue from errors when reciting the Qur’an, whether:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
         <li><strong>Major mistakes (Lahn Jali)</strong> that alter the meaning</li>
         <li><strong>Subtle mistakes (Lahn Khafi)</strong> that affect the precision and beauty of the recitation</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-2">Tajweed ensures that the Qur’an is recited as it was revealed—clearly, beautifully, and with reverence.</p>
   </section>
   <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">How Is Tajweed Learned?</h2>
      <p class="mb-2">Tajweed cannot be mastered through books or digital apps alone. It requires direct transmission (talaqqi) and oral instruction (mushafaha). The two most essential methods are:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
         <li>Listening to a skilled teacher, just as the Companions listened to the Prophet ﷺ.</li>
         <li>Reciting to the teacher and being corrected—this is the core method used in Qur’an schools.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-2">The ideal path is to combine both methods. A student of Tajweed must recognize that this is an auditory science. Some delicate rulings and subtleties cannot be grasped except through face-to-face learning with qualified scholars.</p>
      <p class="mt-2">Listening to expert reciters is helpful, but it can never replace learning directly from a teacher—it only complements the process.</p>
   </section>
   <section class="mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">The Ruling on Learning and Applying Tajweed</h2>
      <p class="mb-2">Scholars have differed on this matter, and their views fall into two main positions:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
         <li><strong>First opinion:</strong> Tajweed is a Sunnah and a refined etiquette of recitation. It is praiseworthy to follow its rules, but it is not strictly obligatory. This is the view of many jurists (fuqahā’).</li>
         <li><strong>Second opinion:</strong> Learning Tajweed is a communal obligation (fard kifāyah), while reciting with Tajweed is a personal obligation (fard ‘ayn)—especially in acts of worship like prayer. This is the opinion held by most scholars of Tajweed.</li>
      </ul>
   </section>
   <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="mb-2">Tajweed is among the most honorable sciences in the service of the Qur’an. It enables Muslims to recite the divine message correctly, beautifully, and by revelation.</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-2">
         <li>Learning Tajweed is an obligation according to one’s ability.</li>
         <li>Applying Tajweed is a spiritual duty and an essential etiquette of recitation, especially during prayer.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We advise the students to seek live learning from qualified teachers and not rely solely on apps or self-study. Tajweed is a listening-based science—its mastery requires oral transmission, patience, and practice.</p>
